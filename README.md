## Origins

This blog is a fork of [Tom Preston-Werner's](http://github.com/mojombo/jekyll), with some notable changes, including:

* Styling / layout -- (obviously), although the general appearance is still fairly similar.
* Tags -- Jekyll doesn't support tags. The included Rakefile adds support and works by generating a 'tags.html' file which is pushed to the repo along with new content. Originally found at: http://gist.github.com/143571

In his [README.textfile](https://github.com/mojombo/mojombo.github.com/blob/master/README.textile) file, Tom Preston-Werner has this to say:

>It is automatically transformed by
>[Jekyll](http://github.com/mojombo/jekyll) into a static site whenever I
>push this repository to GitHub.
>
>I was tired of having my blog posts end up in a database off on some
>remote server. That is backwards. I've lost valuable posts that way. It
>want to author my posts locally in Textile or Markdown. My blog should
>be easily stylable and customizable any way I please. It should take
>care of creating a feed for me. And most of all, my site should be
>stored on GitHub so that I never lose data again.
