I just [discovered](http://www.dailyblogtips.com/time-to-switch-from-feedburner-to-google/ "Time To Switch from Feedburner to Google?") that it was time to migrate my feedburner RSS feeds to google, so I did. Hopefully nobody will notice, anything different, but [please drop me](mailto:&#x6D;&#x61;&#x74;&#x74;&#x2E;&#x70;&#x2E;&#x66;&#x6F;&#x73;&#x74;&#x65;&#x72;&#x40;&#x67;&#x6D;&#x61;&#x69;&#x6C;&#x2E;&#x63;&#x6F;&#x6D;) a line if you do! 

If you aren't subscribed to hackerific's RSS feeds, then why not [subscribe now](http://feeds2.feedburner.com/hackerific "hackerific - Home")? You won't regret it :)
