Welcome to hackerific. A blog on hacking, scripting and cool technologies. 

My aim for this blog is to demonstrate ways of tying together existing technologies to do _cool stuff_. The type of things that you can do without spending weeks and weeks learning loads of specific crazy syntax, or arcane languages. A lot of this will be hacking _around_ things, and combining various small elements to get things done, and most of it will be stuff you could do whilst -procrastinating at work-, chilling at home.

Primarily I'm a UNIX geek, so a lot of the time, things I post here will have a UNIX bent. My hope is that people will find what I have to say interesting, and not think I'm wasting their time, and that they won't be afraid to leave feedback. After all, blogs are supposed to be a two way thing, aren't they?!
